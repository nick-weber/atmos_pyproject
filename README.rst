How to Download:
----------------

- Click the green **Clone or Download** button near the top right of this repository.
- If you are familiar with git, you can copy the URL in the box and run ``git clone [URL]`` in a terminal/command prompt within the desired directory. **Otherwise**, you can click the **Download ZIP** button to download a zip file of this repository.

- Once you have either cloned the repository or unzipped the zip file, move into the new directory (which should be named **atmos_pyproject-master** if you did the download method).

Contains:
---------

- **plotting_tutorial.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that serves as an introduction to using matplotlib and Basemap for making line plots, 2-D contour plots, and 2-D contour plots projected onto maps.

How to do the Plotting Tutorial:
--------------------------------

Here, we assume that users have installed the Anaconda Python distribution.

- In order to interactively do the plotting tutorial (which is a Jupyter Notebook, stored in **plotting_tutorial.ipynb**), you will need to launch the Jupyter Notebook application
- If you are a Mac user, you can do this by simply opening a Terminal window (look for **Terminal** in your Applications) in this project directory, then typing ``jupyter notebook`` into the command prompt.
- Windows users do almost the same thing. Open an **Anaconda Command Prompt** (which you can find by searching your applications) and type ``jupyter notebook`` into the command prompt.
- After launching Jupyter Notebook, a new tab should automatically open up in your browser. You should see all the files and directories within your current directory. Find and click on **plotting_tutorial.ipynb** to launch that notebook.
